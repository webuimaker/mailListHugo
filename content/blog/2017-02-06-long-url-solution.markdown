Emails can have tons of problems. They can get caught in spam filters. Or get misformatted. Or possibly implode. (OK, maybe not.) But here's something you may or may not think of as a problem with email--really, really, really long URLs. Why is this a problem and what's your long URL solution? Well, read on.


## The Long URL Problem




### They Can Sometimes Break


If you paste a long URL into your email, and then it gets reformatted and squished, it may break in half, meaning it won't get translated into a clickable link.

So what should be this: [https://www.mail-list.com/listserv-management-software/](https://www.mail-list.com/listserv-management-software/)

Becomes this: [https://www.mail-list.com/](https://www.mail-list.com/listserv-management-software/)

listserv-management-software/

And people get confused!


### They Take Up a Lot of Space


Even if they don't break, long URLs are just that--long. Which means they look like this in your email client:

## The Long URL Solution




### URL Shorteners


The usual solution for a long URL is to use an URL shortener like [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) or [TinyURL](http://tinyurl.com/). With these sites, you paste your URL in and it comes out with a short version. So you could paste in: [https://www.mail-list.com/listserv-management-software/](https://www.mail-list.com/listserv-management-software/)

And get:

[http://bit.ly/2he9k4q](http://bit.ly/2he9k4q)

Which is great! And very handy for sites like Twitter. The only problem with this method is that your reader can't tell where the URL is going. It might lead to evil viruses. So you have to hope they trust you.


### Brackets


So how do you keep your URLs whole without using an URL shortener? Well, if don't care about the looks of your URLs and just want to make sure that your URL doesn't break, you can just put brackets around your URL instead.

Like this: <https://www.mail-list.com/listserv-management-software/>.

This should signal to any email readers that they should break the URL.
